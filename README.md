# ValmontDataRefresh

This is the repository for the script "Sync_New" and "DDFCompare" which are mainly used in the process of refreshing the data from DDF. However, the script itself can also be used on any other comparison process or syncing process. The script allows users to highlight the major difference between 2 excel files and also check on any addition or removal of an ID within the file.
